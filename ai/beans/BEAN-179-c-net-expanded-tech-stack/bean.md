## Problem Statement

The ai-team-library lacks a c#/.net expanded tech stack. Expand dotnet stack with Blazor, MAUI, Unity-specific patterns. Current stack covers basics; needs deeper framework coverage.

## Goal

Add the stack to `ai-team-library/stacks/` with comprehensive, production-ready guidance.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Expand dotnet stack with Blazor, MAUI, Unity-specific patterns. Current stack covers basics; needs deeper framework coverage.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to the Foundry application code
- Modifications to existing library content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stack file created in `ai-team-library/stacks/` following standardized template
- [ ] Includes: Defaults table with alternatives, Do/Don't lists, Common Pitfalls, Checklist, code examples
- [ ] All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [ ] Lint clean (`uv run ruff check foundry_app/`)
