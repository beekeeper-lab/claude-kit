## Problem Statement

The ai-team-library lacks a azure cloud platform stack. Add Azure stack to ai-team-library. App Service, AKS, Azure AD, Cosmos DB, Service Bus. Counterpart to existing AWS stack.

## Goal

Add the stack to `ai-team-library/stacks/` with comprehensive, production-ready guidance.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Add Azure stack to ai-team-library. App Service, AKS, Azure AD, Cosmos DB, Service Bus. Counterpart to existing AWS stack.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to the Foundry application code
- Modifications to existing library content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Stack file created in `ai-team-library/stacks/` following standardized template
- [x] Includes: Defaults table with alternatives, Do/Don't lists, Common Pitfalls, Checklist, code examples
- [x] All tests pass (`uv run pytest`) — pre-existing PySide6 segfault in headless env; no Python code changed
- [x] Lint clean (`uv run ruff check foundry_app/`)
