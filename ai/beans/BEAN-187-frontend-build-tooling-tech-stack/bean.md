## Problem Statement

The ai-team-library lacks a frontend build & tooling tech stack. Add frontend tooling stack to ai-team-library. Vite, Webpack, monorepo tooling (Nx, Turborepo), bundling, tree-shaking, code splitting.

## Goal

Add the stack to `ai-team-library/stacks/` with comprehensive, production-ready guidance.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Add frontend tooling stack to ai-team-library. Vite, Webpack, monorepo tooling (Nx, Turborepo), bundling, tree-shaking, code splitting.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to the Foundry application code
- Modifications to existing library content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stack file created in `ai-team-library/stacks/` following standardized template
- [ ] Includes: Defaults table with alternatives, Do/Don't lists, Common Pitfalls, Checklist, code examples
- [ ] All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [ ] Lint clean (`uv run ruff check foundry_app/`)
