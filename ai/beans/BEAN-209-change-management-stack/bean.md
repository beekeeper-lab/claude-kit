- Modifications to existing library content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stack file created in `ai-team-library/stacks/` following standardized template
- [ ] Includes: Defaults table with alternatives, Do/Don't lists, Common Pitfalls, Checklist, code examples
- [ ] All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [ ] Lint clean (`uv run ruff check foundry_app/`)
